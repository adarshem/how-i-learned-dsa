# How I Learned DSA

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** study repository! 🚀  

When I first started learning DSA, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information out there. 
It was confusing to figure out where to begin and how to focus on what truly mattered. 
After spending time researching through internet resources, YouTube videos, and developer forums, I was able to create a structured study plan.  

This plan is designed to help me thoroughly understand the basics of DSA and cover the most important and widely used data structures and algorithms. 
I'm sharing it through this repository in the hope that it might benefit others who are on a similar journey. 😊  

## 📚 Learning Plan
1. **Big O Notation**  
   [Learn more](./Big-O/Notes.md)  
   Understanding time and space complexity to analyze algorithm performance.
2. **Data Structures**  
   [Learn more](./Data-Structures/Notes.md)  
   Learning to organize and store data efficiently (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees).
3. **Algorithms**  
   [Learn more](./Algorithms/Notes.md)  
   Exploring problem-solving techniques like sorting and searching.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **[Big-O/](./Big-O/)**  
  Notes and examples on time and space complexity.
- **[Data-Structures/](./Data-Structures/)**  
  Code and notes for various data structures.
- **[Algorithms/](./Algorithms/)**  
  Exercises and notes for implementing algorithms.
- **[Resources/](./Resources/)**  
  Useful links, books, and platforms for additional learning.


## 🛠️ Languages Used
- **Python:** For understanding concepts and solving problems with clean syntax.
- **TypeScript:** For implementing type-safe solutions in a modern, scalable way.

## 🌟 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in DSA for solving real-world problems.
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges.
- Develop a deeper understanding of algorithmic thinking.

## 🔗 Resources
- Explore the **[Resources/](./Resources/)** folder for recommended books, useful links, and platforms.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run a specific TypeScript file, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
2. **Run a specific TypeScript file**:
   ```sh
   pnpm start relative path to the file
   ```
    *For example, to run excercise.ts from Big-0*
      ```sh
      pnpm start src/Big-O/excercise.ts
   ```

To run unit tests, please follow these steps:
1. **Run a specific test**:
   ```sh
   pnpm test relative_path_to_the_spec_file
   ```
2. **Run all specs**:
   ```sh
   pnpm test
   ```
